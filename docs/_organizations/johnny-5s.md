The Johnny 5's (aka Los Locos or just 5's) are a gang of mech-heads that claim to be sentient AI's. Most people dismiss them as yet another bunch of violent cyber-psychos but most such groups burn out or implode before long as their psychoses inevitably lead to turning violent on each other. The 5's, however, have maintained their cohesion over the years and even pulled off a few highly sophisticated capers leading a few crackpots to sound the alarm that the singularity has finally arrived.
