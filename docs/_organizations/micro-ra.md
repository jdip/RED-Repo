Microsoft-Rafael Ltd is a global conglomerate formed from the merger of the American software company and the secretive Israeli defense contractor. They are known for their Cortana Agent software as well as a line of cyberware that is ultra advanced hardware wise but is known to be glitchy because it runs on ancient windows embedded systems. Some top notch netrunners are able to jailbreak them and install the much more reliable Raspcallion OS (a  descendant of modern day Raspberry Pi linux variant Raspian)

The Israeli wing of the corporation is still angry that the American marketing group went with a logo and brand evocative of the Egyptian god Ra. The head of marketing at the time responded to the complaints with "its all pile of sand anyway, what's the difference?" She died of a heart attack a short time later. The odds of both her meatware heart and her hardware life monitoring system malfunctioning at the same time were pegged at 0.0000001% by outside analysts.

Some fringe conspiracy theorists believe this was a covered up assassination. Others believe the cover-up was to hide a flaw in the Micro-Ra Healthy-Safe 2053 VSMP (Vital Systems Monitoring Platform).
