Daimler-VW is the biggest player based in Europe and has steadily gobbled up a wide variety of corporations across the euro-zone. Its warchest contains the likes of: Airbus, SIG Sauer, Ferrari, Siemens, BASF, AB InBev, and Aldi. This European behemoth was almost singlehandedly responsible for destroying the Amazon empire through the innovate Al-Life initiative: a tailored zero-shopping lifestyle in which Aldi-style generics of all kinds of goods (later services) are automatically purchased and delivered based upon the end-users finances and needs as perceived by an advanced life management AI. Early adopters raved and the service quickly built up a substantial, cult-like following. Combined with major attacks on world-wide internet infrastructure, including targeted terrorist bombing of it's datacenters, Jeff Bezos' once thought unassailable position crumbled. And it all happened faster then anybody would have believed, leading some to speculate if there wasn't a guiding hand behind it all.

A noted side-effect of the Al-Life program was a crushing blow to advertising of all kinds. With purchasing agency taken away from the end-user, marketing firms quickly found that every penny spent on a member of the program was a penny wasted. This lead to a desperate surge of ever more invasive practices targeted at those still in control of their own purchasing decisions, which only increased the speed at which people converted to Al-Life. Many advertising dependent enterprises like the Google-YouTube syndicate were devastated.

This, of course, all preceded the Drone Wars in which hunter-killer drones of rival corporations relentlessly preyed on the cumbersome bumble-bee like delivery drones that made such services possible, inevitably leading to a resurgence of localized retail outlets and advertising.
