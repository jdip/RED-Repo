    <h3>Melee Combat Resolution:</h3>
    <div>Attacker's DEX + Relevant Melee Skill + 1d10</div>

<p>With the exception of Very Heavy Melee Weapons, all Melee combat is 2 ROF, allowing for 2 strikes to be
    made with every Attack Action. <strong>Targets must be in your reach (2m/yards).</strong></p>

<p>If you beat the DV (Defender wins in a tie) you damage the Defender.</p>
    <p>The Defender's armor will reduce the damage you do, as
    detailed later in this section on pg. 186.</p>

<br>
<h3>Brawling, Boxing, and Grappling</h3>
<p>Brawling uses the <strong>Brawling Skill</strong> to attack, and the damage dealt with each blow scales with the attacker's
    BODY STAT. Brawling is also the Skill used for initiating and defending
    against a Grapple. <strong>When dealing damage, a Brawling attack does not ignore half the Defender's
        armor</strong>.</p>
