Wetleaf is a bizarre combination of hippy commune philosophy, Appalachian mountain folk cults, and chemical industry. It is the de facto gateway through the [Nekalacchia]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/nekalacchia.md %}) mountains into the breadbasket of the region. The only “safe” highway  into the [Nekalacchia Valley]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/nekalacchia-valley.md %}) passes through the area where the best tech from larger urban areas is exchanged for commodities consisting primarily of synth-meats, veggie-gels, and narcotics. Many of Wetleaf's burbclaves are highly independent and fortified on a level not seen in other areas of similar socio-economic status. Attempts from outsiders to infiltrate the local power structures often prove fruitless. The strict clan structures of the Wetleaf burbclaves all but requires a familial relationship just to get a literal foot in the door. Attempts to circumvent the stranglehold the denizens of the area have on trade to the valley are met with extreme hostility.
