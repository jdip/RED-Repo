Turns out endlessly pumping billions of tons of carbon into an atmosphere starts to look a lot like a concerted terra-forming effort after a few centuries. What was once rolling verdant forest in the northern end of the former state of Virginia dried up half a century ago. The resulting scrubland is beginning to give way shifting dunes.

The main artery into the interior of North America, Interstate 90, is a dangerous road in the stretch between [Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/burnsey.md %}) and the far off mountains. Hard to spot dunes can creep across on the wind, forcing most sane travellers to keep a pace with only two digits on the speedometer. But that only makes them an easy target for the ruthless bandits that populate the sands.
