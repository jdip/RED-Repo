Franklin is a strictly zoned mix of everything Constance City has to offer. [North Franklin]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/north-franklin.md %}) rivals [Constance Island]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/constance-island.md %}) in glitz, if not security. The eastern and northwestern burbclave complexes between Interstate 321 and the coast offer some of the best middle class living arrangements that can be found, and [Central]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/central.md %}) is a less rusty version of the massive industrial parks found in [Trogill]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/trogill.md %}). 

But the clean veneer of the vibrant burrow beguns to wear thin the further south and west you go, finally succumbing to the filth of the stacks creeping out of [Guerny]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/guerny.md %}).
