A Brief history of Constance City: Endlessly changing, but always the fucking same.

Everybody was always worried about when the “Big One” was going to hit California. But the thing is, an active fault network is a healthy one. Stress builds up, then we do a little dance, and stress gets relieved. Nobody thought too much about how the Appalachians had been built by the same processes as the Rockies. The faults were there, they were just so old that the process had ground to a halt.

By the year 2070 trillions had been spent to spare the population centers on the east coast from the ravages of a rising sea. The bulk of the countryside, however, had been written off as too expensive to save and slipped beneath the waves. But water is _heavy_ and all of that extra pressure pushing down on the once dry land woke up the slumbering fault lines. 

When the series of monster earthquakes that dunked the eastern seaboard into the ocean finally eased off, Emil Constantine was in a unique position. He had built an empire by revitalizing American heavy industry. His cleverly engineered HiveBot system of gargantuan central “queen” automated heavy lift vehicles quickly proved the pundits wrong. Each controlled and was supported by a swarm of specialized bots that ensured the semi-autonomous queen always had the tools needed for the job the HiveBot was assigned. If a mine shaft ran dry in Nekallachia or a new steel mill was completed in Troghill, none of the upfront investment was wasted as the HiveBot swarm could just move on and adapt to the next assignment.

And when his sprawling company town in northern Virginia suddenly found itself on the new east coast, instead of ramping down operations due to losing 67% of his customer base to the Atlantic Ocean, he ramped up. In the three years following the quakes Constance Industries dug up and processed more steel than in the three decades prior, and every ounce went into local building projects.

Tens of millions had survived the disaster, and they needed somewhere to go. For many the newly booming Constance City was the best, and only, choice. The most fortunate were able to scrape together enough of their former fortunes to start over on newly glittering Constance Island, while the most desperate were piled into the hastily built stacks of Guerny.

With the federal government literally underwater, and most state governments overwhelmed, Emil was free to run his city like an independent city state. What started as a temporary situation slowly became a permanent reality as Constantine deftly outmaneuvered the New Republics that rose out of the waves and remained a neutral party by playing one of the other.

By 2090 the momentum of the aptly nicknamed “New New York” had begun to slow, but investment in building projects had been a sure thing for nearly two decades and many developers continued to put their faith, and their money, into that mythical unicorn called perpetual growth. If Constantine himself had still been around to deftly steer the city away from economic disaster, maybe he would have, but he had died the previous year at the ripe old age of 121.
 
The council of sycophants that found themselves in power after his passing either didn’t see the signs or ignored them. The resulting years of budget crises left much of the hastily built infrastructure unmaintained. By the turn of the century the crumbling was in full swing. A city that had sprung up out of the ground not thirty years before started to look like the gutted, centuries old former giants of the Rust Belt.

These days (year 2115), some analysts are starting to predict the lean times are over. Most of the rest of the world is finally back on its feet now the climate change induced flooding has stabilized to a new normal. They are certain the sound industrial foundation given to the city by it’s progenitor will be a springboard to new heights as global trade picks up once again. But a city made up of the cynical survivors of a monumental catastrophy doesn’t spare much time on optimism. Legions of others loudly proclaim these eternal bright-siders are full of shit.
