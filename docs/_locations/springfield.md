Springfield began life as the executive playground for those that ruled over the old [Constance Industries]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _organizations/constance-industries.md %}) company town of [Trogill]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/trogill.md %}). The isolated and walled off burbclaves in the area still stand, but are now the scuffed residences of middle management. The truly wealthy long ago flew off the heights of [Constance Island]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/constance-island.md %}) and [North Franklin]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/north-franklin.md %})
