Splice: while difficult to actually define, “splice” is a term for custom designed software that induces incredible euphoric sensations to the users. Such software is automatically flagged by all Net vectors and is usually only found at ad hoc cafés known as “splice shacks.”  Users are known as “splicers”, Twitchers”, or “TTV’s”. The latter stemming from the  early 21st broadcasting platform “Twitch”.   Developers and purveyors or such software are known as “splice masters” or “operators”.
