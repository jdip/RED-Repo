<h1>RED REPO</h1>
<h4>Find what you need to finish the job Choomba.</h4>
<BR>
<p>
    This site is a quick reference for the Tabletop RPG Cyberpunk RED
</p>

<p>
    Since the project repo is publicly hosted on
    <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> you can fork or download your own copy and modify it as you wish.
    It will take some technical knowledge and familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Markdown as it is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Feel free to download or fork your own version to modify as you like. I will accept merge requests into the main repo if I subjectively think they fit the purpose of this site and are high quality.
    This determination will be based solely on my own imperfect opinion.
