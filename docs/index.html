<h1>Welcome to Constance City</h1>
<h4>Endlessly changing, always the fucking same.</h4>
<BR>
<p>
    This site is a repository for lore surrounding the titular
    <a href="{{ '/locations/constance-city/' | relative_url }}">Constance City</a>
    , a homebrew setting for the table top role playing game <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/cyberpunk/">Cyberpunk RED</a>.
    It is primarily being built for use in a private game hosted on <a href="https://roll20.net">Roll20</a>: Con City Claimers.
    As the world evolves and lore gets added either through world building or organically through play,
    this site will be updated with expanded entries fleshing out and detailing the locations, organizations and
    people of Con City.
</p>

<p>
    Feel free to use as much or as little of the content found here for your own game as you want. Since the project repo is publically hosted on
    <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> you can fork or download your own copy and modify it as you wish.
    It will take some technical knowledge and familiarity with HTML, CSS, and Markdown as it is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
    If you put togther some cool content and wish to share, I may accept merge requests into the main repo if I subjectively think they fit the established world and are high quality.
    This determination will be based solely on my own imperfect opinion. If I reject a request, it doesn't mean you or your content sucks, it just means I don't think it would fit with my personal homebrew game.
    Its totally me, not you.
