  have time to do what you need to do (crimes, killing

  going to the store to get something you forgot. There
  are many reasons why almost everyone has one.</p>
  Things your Agent can do:
  <ul class=\"bullet-list\">
  <li>Make phone calls in voice or video and record
  them, forward them, or send them to voicemail,
  which pretty much only Agents actually end up
  listening to nowadays.
  <li>Surf the Data Pool.
  <li>Scan the Data Pool to locate a known location
  and bring up directions.
  <li>Keep your schedule for you and act independently
  on events, like ordering a gift and
  having it delivered to the recipient.
  <li>Maintain a personality complete with name,
  voice, and virtual body. Some particularly lonely
  individuals reprogram their Agents to act as surrogate
  lovers or friends.
  <li>Suggest clothes for you to buy.
  <li>Record audio and video to the Agent's standard
  Memory Chip.
  <li>Link to your Cyberware to share data storage with
  them and the Agent's Memory Chip.
  <li>Link to most appliances in your living space.
  <li>Monitor your use of easily acquired resources
  (Cheap, Everyday, or Costly) and automatically
  reorder them when you get low at market price.
  <li>Recommend a future course of action based on
  your personal goals. AI may suggest unwise
  actions.
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to all this, <strong>an Agent gives the user +2
  to their Library Search Skill and +2 to their
  Wardrobe & Style Skill</strong>, but only if you wear the
  clothes your Agent suggests for you, which change
  every season. Multiple Agents don't multiply these
