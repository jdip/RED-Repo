  have time to do what you need to do (crimes, killing
  people, getting away with it, and so forth) instead of
  going to the store to get something you forgot. There
  are many reasons why almost everyone has one.</p>
  Things your Agent can do:
  <ul class=\"bullet-list\">
  <li>Make phone calls in voice or video and record
  them, forward them, or send them to voicemail,
  which pretty much only Agents actually end up
  listening to nowadays.
  <li>Surf the Data Pool.
  <li>Scan the Data Pool to locate a known location
  and bring up directions.
  <li>Keep your schedule for you and act independently
  on events, like ordering a gift and
  having it delivered to the recipient.
  <li>Maintain a personality complete with name,
  voice, and virtual body. Some particularly lonely
  individuals reprogram their Agents to act as surrogate
  lovers or friends.
  <li>Suggest clothes for you to buy.
  <li>Record audio and video to the Agent's standard
  Memory Chip.
  <li>Link to your Cyberware to share data storage with
  them and the Agent's Memory Chip.
  <li>Link to most appliances in your living space.
  <li>Monitor your use of easily acquired resources
  (Cheap, Everyday, or Costly) and automatically
  reorder them when you get low at market price.
  <li>Recommend a future course of action based on
  your personal goals. AI may suggest unwise
  actions.
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to all this, <strong>an Agent gives the user +2
  to their Library Search Skill and +2 to their
  Wardrobe & Style Skill</strong>, but only if you wear the
  clothes your Agent suggests for you, which change
  every season. Multiple Agents don't multiply these
  bonuses.</p>

                while you're busy brain-burning that fool who just dared to pop a Hellhound on you. Many Netrunners wear
                clothing over their Bodyweight Suits, but plenty don't. It's a matter of personal style. <strong>Unlike other armor,
                a Bodyweight Suit isn't bought in two pieces, and must always be worn on both your
                body and head location.</strong> Each location has its own SP11. When repaired, both pieces are repaired at
                the same time. You can't wear more than one Bodyweight Suit. <strong>Wearing a Bodyweight Suit adds one
                Hardware only Option Slot to a Cyberdeck connected to it.</strong> Hardware installed in the Bodyweight
                Suit cannot be accessed if the armor isn't worn and can only take up 1 Option Slot."
