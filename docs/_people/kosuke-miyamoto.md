The grand-nephew of famed video game visionary Shigeru Miyamoto, Kosuke, shares the former's creativity and genius, but has applied it to a stunning rollercoaster rise through the world of mega-corporations. Starting with just a small share of the family fortune, he has routinely outmaneuvered those with bigger warchests and seemingly better positions in the market. 

Once hailed as the next Warren Buffet, Kosuke long ago eclipsed that comparison and moved beyond mere investment to become one of the most powerful people on the planet at the helm of Japan's pre-eminent mega-corp.
