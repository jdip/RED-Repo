<h1>Health</h1>
<h2>Stabilization</h2>
<p>Before healing can begin, a wounded character must be stabilized, by taking the <a href="{{ 'actions/stabilize/' | relative_url }}">Stabilize</a> action.</a></p>
<p>Once successful stabilization has been reached, the
    target will heal a number of Hit Points equal to their
    BODY for each full day they spend resting, spending the majority of each day taking it easy and doing
    only light activity, until they are at Full HP again. If the
    patient pushes it, they will gain no HP that day, their
    wounds will reopen, and they will need to receive stabilization
    again to restart the natural healing process.</p>

<h2>Treating Critical Injuries</h2>
<p>Critical Injuries can be treated according to the Skills and DVs listed on the Critical Injuries tables found on the
    <a href="{{ '/trauma/' | relative_url }}">Trauma</a> page.</p> If the location of the wound is made up of Cyberware, then the Cybertech Skill is substituted for any listed skill check types.</p>

<p>A Quick Fix can be performed on oneself, takes a minute, and will alleviate the effect for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Treatment must be performed by somebody else, takes 4 hours, and will permanently remove the effect.</p>

<h2>Hospital Visits</h2>
<p>When you check into a hospital, you are only charged for the Highest DV Stabilization or Treatment required to heal you fully.</p>
