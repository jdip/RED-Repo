<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>Going without at least 6 hours of sleep a day will
    give you a -2 to everything you attempt for each day
    since you've last slept a full 6 hours.</p>
<p>Sleeping in an uncomfortable situation will leave
    you fatigued the next day, which will penalize you an
    additional -2 to everything you attempt while fatigued.
    This won't kill you, but it doesn't feel good, either.</p>

<p><strong>Being crammed</strong>: sleeping in housing with a
number of persons greater than 1 + the number
of bedrooms. Persons unconscious in Cryo-stasis
and corpses do not count toward this limit. A Cube
Hotel is the only exception. Sleeping with more
than one person in a cube is always sleeping
uncomfortable and will leave you fatigued the
    next day.</p>
<p><strong>Sleeping on the street</strong>. Unless you make a
successful DV15 Endurance Check, sleeping on
the street will leave you fatigued. Sleeping on the
    street is also asking for trouble. <strong>Sleeping in a car not equipped for it is slightly safer, but no more comfortable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sleeping in the wilderness</strong>. Unless you make
a successful DV15 Wilderness Survival Check,
sleeping in the wilderness will leave you fatigued.
Unlike sleeping on the street, other persons can
roll this Wilderness Survival Check for you.
    Nomad friends are nice to have.</p>

<h2>Optional Humanity Loss/Gain</h2>
<p>To encourage players to spend their money on improving their character's lives you can apply the following
    bonuses/penalties to a character's Humanity depending on their housing, lifestyle, and luxury expenses.</p>
<p>For every week of game time that goes by, select one adjustment from each category that that best fits the characters
    life for the week. Roll an Empathy Check (1d10 + EMP) versus the listed DV. If the adjustment is negative succeeding
    on the check results in no change of humanity, while a failure results in the listed humanity loss. Conversely, if
    the adjustment is positive succeeding results in gaining the listed humanity and failing results in no change.</p>

<p>Luxury spending can be anything from retail therapy, social events, entertainment, or anything else a character might
    splurge on in an attempt to make themselves happy.</p>
<p>Other events can have an impact on Humanity as well, such as failing in a mission or goal, killing a person, losing a loved one, falling in love, or doing a good deed.
    The amount of humanity gain or loss in such cases is specific to the situation and will be decided by your GM.</p>

<h3>Luxury/Charity Spending</h3>
<p>Spending money during a week on luxury items constitutes "retail therapy" allowing for some humanity gains. The more you spend, the lower the DV for the empathy check to gain humanity, and the higher the reward.</p>
<p><strong>You can optionally donate to charity to automatically succeed on the empathy check.</strong></p>

<h3>Drug Addiction</h3>
<p>Remaining addicted to drugs will slowly sap your humanity. Each week that you do not take steps to treat your addiction roll a <a href="{{ '/skills/resist-torture-drugs' | relative_url }}">Resist Torture/Drugs</a> check vs the DV on the following table to determine humanity loss.</p>
<p>You are considered to be "sober" on any day that your didn't take at least one dose of the drug you are addicted to. Make a separate check for each drug addiction.</p>
