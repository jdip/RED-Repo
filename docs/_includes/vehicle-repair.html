<h3>Vehicle Repair</h3>
The DV and amount of
time it takes you to repair
a damaged/destroyed
vehicle with a TECH Skill to
perfect condition is based
on the amount of damage
it has sustained.

On a failed roll, halfway
through the repair, you
realize that you'll have
to start the repair from
scratch.
