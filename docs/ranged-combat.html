<h1>Ranged Combat</h1>

<h3>Ranged Combat is resolved:</h3><br>
<strong><div class="center">Attacker's REF + Relevant Weapon Skill + 1d10</div>
<div class="center">vs.</div>
<div class="center">Defender's DV* or Defender's DEX + Evasion Skill + 1d10**</div>
</strong>
<p><small><em>* Determined by Range to Target and Weapon</em></small></p>
<p><small><em>** A Defender with a REF 8 or higher can choose to attempt to dodge a Ranged Attack instead of using the range table to determine the DV</em></small></p>

<p>If you beat the DV (Defender wins in a tie) you damage the Defender.</p>
    <p>The Defender's armor will reduce the damage you do, as
    detailed later in this section on pg. 186.</p>

<h2>Alternate Fire Modes and Special Features</h2>
<h3>Autofire</h3>

<p>When you use Autofire, it costs an Action and 10 bullets. <strong>If you don't have 10
    bullets remaining in your clip, you can't use Autofire.</strong> You use the <strong>Autofire
    Skill</strong> instead of the weapon's typical Weapon Skill. Additionally, instead of the weapon's
    entry on the Range Table, you use its entry on the Autofire Range Table. <strong>Autofire
        cannot be used to make an Aimed Shot.</strong></p>

<p>Targets with REF 8 or Higher can still choose to attempt to dodge your Autofire.</p>
<p><strong>If you hit, roll 2d6 for damage, and multiply it by the amount you beat
    the DV to hit your target, up to a maximum denoted by the weapon's
    Autofire (3 for SMGS, 4 for Assault Rifles).</strong> This number is the amount of damage
    that Autofire dealt. If both dice came up 6, you've also inflicted a Critical Injury (see
    pg. 187)! The Defender's armor reduces the damage you do, as detailed later in this
    section on pg. 186.</p>

<h3>Arrows</h3>
<p>Bows and Crossbows fire Arrows. Because
    loading an Arrow is part of attacking with a Bow
    or Crossbow, <strong>you never need to Reload a
        Bow or Crossbow using the Reload Action.</strong>
    Additionally, <strong>Basic Arrows</strong> can always be retrieved
    after they are fired, making buying basic ammunition
    for these weapons almost a one-time investment.</p>

<h3>Suppressive Fire</h3>

<p>When you use Suppressive Fire, it costs an Action and
    10 Bullets. <strong>If you don't have 10 Bullets remaining
        in your clip, you can't use Suppressive
        Fire.</strong></p>

<p>Everyone on foot within 25 m/yds, out of cover, and
    in your line of sight must roll <strong>WILL + Concentration
        + 1d10</strong> against your <strong>REF + Autofire Skill + 1d10.</strong></p>

<p>Anyone that fails must use their next Move Action to
    get into cover. If that Move Action would be insufficient
    to get into cover, they must also use the Run Action to
    get into cover or as close to cover as possible.</p>

<h3>Shotgun Shells</h3>

<p>In addition to Slugs, Shotguns can also fire Shotgun
    Shells. You can't make an Aimed Shot with a Shotgun
    Shell. When you fire a Shotgun Shell, you make 1
    Ranged Attack (REF + Shoulder Arms + 1d10) vs. a
    DV13. If successful every target in front of you, within
    6m/yds (3 squares), that you can see, takes 3d6
    damage if you hit. You roll damage once for all targets.
    The Defender's armor will reduce the damage you do,
    as detailed later in this section on pg. 186.</p>

<p>Individual targets with REF 8 or Higher can still
    choose to attempt to dodge your Shotgun Shell.</p>

<h3>Explosives</h3>

<p>All explosives weapons <strong>deal their damage to all
    targets (including the terrain) in a 10m/yd
    by 10m/yd area (5 Square by 5 Square)</strong>, the
    center of which is your intended target (which is a 2m/
    yd by 2m/yd square, not an individual). You only
    roll damage once for all targets.</p>

<p>If you roll under the DV required to hit your intended
    target, the GM decides where in that 10m/yard by
    10m/yard square centered on your intended target
    the explosive actually landed, and it instead damages
    a 10m/yard by 10m/yard square around that point.</p>

<p>Anyone with REF 8 or higher can choose to individually
    dodge the blast by rolling higher than your
    original Check, placing themselves outside of the blast
    area if they succeed.</p>

<p>An explosive blast will not damage a target behind
    cover that its damage would be insufficient to destroy.
    However, if the damage from the explosive would be
    sufficient to destroy the cover, the individual is no
    longer behind cover and they take full damage.</p>
