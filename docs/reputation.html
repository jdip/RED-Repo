<h2>Reputation</h2>
<p>When first meeting,
    Characters roll 1d10. A Character that rolls under
    the Reputation Level of the person they are meeting
    has heard of them. Good or Bad.</p>

<h2>Facedowns</h2>
<p>Reputation in Cyberpunk RED has one other big effect: Facedowns. A lot of combat
    in Cyberpunk RED comes down to a duel of willsâ€”who's tougher, meaner, and looks
    more ready to prove it. This often leads to what are called Facedowns, when two heavies
    on The Street square off just before a fight or to see who'll back down from a confrontation.
    The GM will call for a Facedown whenever they feel the scene calls for it. When
    making a Facedown, both participants will roll:</p>
<div class="center">COOL + Reputation<sup>*</sup> + 1d10</div>
<p><small><sup>*</sup><em>If your defining Reputation Event is for cowardice your
    Reputation Level is treated as a negative number.</em></small></p>

<p>The losing character of a facedown must either backdown or take a -2 to any future Actions made against the opponent due to fear until they have defeated them once.</p>
