<h2>Taking Damage</h2>
<BR>
<p><strong>Whenever you take damage:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Your Attacker rolls the damage for their attack.</li>
    <li>Subtract your armor's SP in that location (if they didn't target your head using an Aimed Shot, this is always your body location) from the damage.* Subtract any remaining damage from your Hit Points.</li>
    <li>If you ended up taking any damage, your armor on that location is still ablated, reducing its SP by 1 point, until it is repaired.</li>
</ol>
<p><small><em>* Some things that cause damage, like poisons and fire, bypass armor.</em></small></p>

<h2>Death Saves</h2>

<p>
    <strong>At the start of each of your Turns where you are Mortally Wounded, you must make a Death
        Save</strong>. Roll a d10. If you roll under your BODY, you live, and can take your Turn as usual. <strong>If you roll a 10, you
    automatically fail your Death Save</strong>. Every time you roll a Death Save, your Death Save Penalty increases,
    meaning each future Death Save you roll is made with an additional +1, making it progressively harder to stave
    off death. This Death Save Penalty continues to add up until you are brought back to 1HP by Stabilization,
</p>
<h3>If you fail even a single Death Save, you die.</h3>
<BR><BR>

<H2>Critical Injuries</H2>
<p><strong>Whenever two or more dice rolled for damage from a Melee or
    Ranged Attack come up 6, you've inflicted a Critical Injury!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Roll 2d6 on the appropriate Critical Injury Table until you get a Critical Injury that the target
    isn't currently suffering.</strong> If you weren't using an Aimed Shot to target the head, roll on the Critical Injuries
to the Body Table.</p>
<p><strong>All Critical Injuries cause a horrible Injury Effect and deal 5 Bonus Damage</strong> directly to the
    target's Hit Points when suffered. The Bonus Damage doesn't ablate armor and isn't modified by hit location.</p>
<p>Critical Injuries and their Bonus Damage are inflicted regardless of if any of the attack's damage got through
    the target's SP.</p>

<p><strong>If the location of the wound is made up of Cyberware then substitute Cybertech Skill for the Quick Fix and/or Treatment Skill Checks.</strong></p>
