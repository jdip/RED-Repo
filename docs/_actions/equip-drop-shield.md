Equipping and dropping a shield takes an Action. While you are using a hand to carry a shield, it cannot be used to do anything else. A shield is a movable source of cover, and while you wield a shield with HP remaining, you are considered to be in cover. When attacked by a target that you can see, you can interpose the shield between yourself and the attack. If you choose to do so, you cannot dodge the attack at all, though a Ranged Attack can still miss you due to your opponent's poor marksmanship. The shield takes the entire attack to its HP. If a shield hits 0 HP it is destroyed (until repaired if inorganic), and cannot be used as cover, though it still remains equipped to your hand until you use an Action to drop it.

### Human Shields
We all knew it would come to this. **If you are already the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to "equip" the defender as a Human Shield** if you are not already wielding a shield, using the same hand you are using to Grapple them. 

While you wield a Human Shield, you are considered in cover. Human Shields are more unwieldy than typical shields. Because of their squirming, Human Shields cannot be used to block Melee Attacks, or Ranged Attacks specifically targeted at your head using an Aimed Shot. When attacked by a target that you can see with a Ranged Attack not targeted at your head, you can interpose the Human Shield between yourself and the Ranged Attack.
 
**You can still attack your own Human Shield while you have them equipped, it's practically a tradition.** Your Human Shield cannot dodge Ranged Attacks while you have them equipped, even if they have REF 8 or higher. When your Human Shield is shot, they take damage as if they had been shot normally.
  
**A Human Shield who dies while you have them equipped automatically becomes a shield with HP equal to their BODY.** Unequipping a live Human Shield is as simple as ending your Grapple with them, which doesn't cost an Action, but dropping a corpse shield costs an Action just like any other shield.
