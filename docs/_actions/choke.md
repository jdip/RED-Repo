description: Choke an opponent you have Grabbed.

If you are currently the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to Choke the Defender you are grappling, dealing your BODY STAT directly to their Hit Points in damage. If damage dealt by a Choke would reduce a target with more than 1 HP to less than 0 HP, they are instead left at 1 HP and are Unconscious. **This damage ignores the Defender's armor and doesn't ablate it**. Additionally, if you Choke the same target for 3 successive Rounds, they go Unconscious regardless of their Hit Point total.
