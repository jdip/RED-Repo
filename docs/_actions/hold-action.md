name: Hold Action
description:  Hold an Action until later in the Round.
---

In combat, a Character can use this Action to Hold
off on one specific Action until a designated number
in the Initiative Queue comes up, or a specified event
occurs. When that time comes, they can choose to
either go through with their chosen Action or forgo
it entirely. You can’t Hold an Action across multiple
Rounds. You can’t change your mind about when the
action triggers, either. Move Actions and NET Actions
cannot be Held at all.
