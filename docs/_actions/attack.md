description: Make a Melee or Ranged Attack.
---

Use an Action to make an attack with [Ranged Combat]({{ site.baseurl }}/ranged-combat/)
or [Melee Combat]({{ site.baseurl }}/melee-combat/). Check out the Combat System (pg.
    167) for information on how to make an attack.

Drawing an easily accessible weapon, or dropping one does not take up an action. It is possible to drop a weapon, draw a new one and attack all during a single turn.

However, [stowing]({{ site.baseurl }}/actions/stow-a-weapon/) a weapon back into its holster or otherwise putting it away does take an action.
