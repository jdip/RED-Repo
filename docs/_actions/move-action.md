name: Move Action
description: Move up to as many m/yds as your MOVE STAT x 2 each Turn (or squares equal to your MOVE STAT).
---

Every Turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which
can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal
to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares (if playing
on a grid) equal to their MOVE, which can include
moving diagonally. If you are playing on a grid, you
cannot stop in between the squares.
### Prone
When you are Prone, you can't use your Move Action
until you use the [Get Up]({{ base_url }}/actions/get-up/) Action.

### Split Movement and ROF

Combat in Cyberpunk RED is fast-paced and
fluid. Whenever you Move using your Move Action,
you can take your Action in the middle of that Move
Action, and then keep Moving afterwards. We call this
Splitting, and it's not just for Move Actions. Some types
of attacks are faster than others, capable of striking/
shooting twice with a single Attack Action.

These are called 2 Rate of Fire Attacks (or 2 ROF).
All attacks from 2 ROF sources can be "split" across
a Move Action. You can move, shoot, move, shoot,
move. You can even make a single attack from each
of two different 2 ROF sources by "Splitting" your
two attacks across the two of them, allowing them
both to be used in a single Turn. So yes, you can
use the Heavy Pistol in your left hand to take a shot
down the hallway, then walk down that disgusting
hallway to stab your victim with the machete in your
right hand.

Attacks from 1 ROF sources are slower, and take
your whole Attack Action, but you can still split movement
around them.

### Other Forms of Movement
Swimming, Climbing, and Jumping with a running
start all cost 2 m/yds of movement for every m/yd
traveled or 2 squares for every 1 square. When
jumping from standing you can clear half the distance
that you could with a running start. See Taking
Damage later in this section (pg. 180) for more on
falling and drowning.
