North Burnsey was the result of a building boom that originated in [Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/burnsey.md %}) in the 2080's. As real estate in the original burrow became scarce, developers looked north for new expansion. But the once roaring population growth of the city slowed to a trickle just as some of the most ambitious project were underway, leaving much of North Burnsey a half-finished, unoccupied wasteland.
