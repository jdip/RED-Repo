A tiny collection of buildings along Interstate 90 midway between [Constance City]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/constance-city.md %}) and the mountains to the west. One of the few places where it isn't considered outright insane to actually stop in [The Shift]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/the-shift.md %}).
