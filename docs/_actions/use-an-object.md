name: Use an Object
description: Manipulate an object in a way that doesn't require a Skill
---

Use this Action as a catch-all for using/manipulating/
picking up an object in ways that wouldn't require
using a Skill and aren't covered by other Actions, but
would still require a quick 3 seconds of effort. Use
this for things like opening up a door, switching your
held shotgun out for an assault rifle slung on your
back, picking up an unattended weapon off the floor,
pressing the button on a detonator, or biting into a
slice of pizza. If the GM determines your proposed
task would take more than 3 seconds, and you still
want to do it, you can spend your Action every Turn
to attempt to accomplish it, at a rate of 3 seconds per
Turn. Drawing an easily accessible weapon isn't an
Action if you have a free hand.
