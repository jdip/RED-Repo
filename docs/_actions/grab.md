name: Grab
description: Initiate a grapple with an opponent.
---

As an Action you can grab and hold someone, take an object they are carrying, or escape a grapple. You need a free hand to initiate a Grab, which cannot be used to do anything else for the duration of any Grapple that results from the Grab.
 
 To determine the outcome of a Grab, both you and your target within your reach roll **DEX + Brawling Skill + 1d10**. If you win, you can choose to either grab hold of the Defender or take one object the Defender is holding in their hands into a free hand.
 
 If you win and choose to grab hold of the Defender instead of their stuff, both of you are now considered to be in a Grapple and take a -2 to all Actions for as long as you both remain in a Grapple.
 
 While Grappled, the Defender cannot use their Move Action, and is dragged with the Attacker whenever the Attacker takes their Move Action. No Character in the Grapple can make use of a weapon that requires them to use two hands, even if they have more than two arms. The Attacker can end the Grapple at any time without using an Action, but the Defender, or any other Character, must use this Action to roll a successful Grab against the Attacker to break the Grapple, which ends the Grapple for everyone involved. Grabbing a person is a prerequisite for Choking or Throwing them.
