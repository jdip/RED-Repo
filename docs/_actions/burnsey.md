Burnsey started as a hastily erected stack complex similar to [Guerny]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/guerny.md %}), but in the early 2080's was devastated by a series of fires that some claim were intentionally set. Whatever the cause, the result was a second building boom chock-full of the most fashionable burbclaves and sophisticated arcologies. Investment in real-estate development became a near guarantee of riches, leading to an unprecedented explosion of building projects toward the latter half of the 2080's that extended up into the newly christened [North Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/north-burnsey.md %}) before the bottom dropped out, leaving much of [North Burnsey]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/north-burnsey.md %}) a half-finished wasteland.
