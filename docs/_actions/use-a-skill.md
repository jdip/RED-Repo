Use an Action to use one of your Skills to attempt to
accomplish a quick task (3 seconds max). If the GM
determines your proposed task would take more than
3 seconds, and you still want to do it, you can spend
your Action every Turn to attempt to accomplish it, at
a rate of 3 seconds per Turn, making your Check only
when you've finished the duration of the task. Task
resolution is covered in Resolving Actions with Skills
later on this page.
