Guerny is a ramshackle collection of hastily built "stacks": open steel scaffolds with a stairway and basic utility shaft. It is up to the residents to provide everything else. Mobile homes and even RV vehicles are sometimes hoisted and slotted directly into a level as a complete housing solution, but those that were able to afford such luxury during the desperate post-flood days are the lucky ones.
