name: Aimed Shot
description: Make an aimed Melee or Ranged Attack.
---

At a maximum of 1 ROF you can aim a single [Ranged]({{ site.baseurl }}/ranged-combat/) or [Melee]({{ site.baseurl }}/melee-combat/) Attack by
taking your entire Action and a -8 to your Check to aim for any of these
special areas. If you hit, you deal the attack's damage as normal, and you also get
an additional effect based on the special area you aimed for.


Aiming for... | Effect
--------------|-------
Head | Multiply the damage that gets through your target's head armor by 2.
Held Item | If a single point of damage gets through your target's body armor, your target drops one item of your choice held in their hands. It lands on the ground in front of them.
Leg | If a single point of damage gets through your target's body armor, your target also suffers the Broken Leg Critical Injury if they have any legs left that aren't broken.
