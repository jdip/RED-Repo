Nekalacchia is a new name for a small section of an old mountain range. Originally a derisive mashup of "Red Neck" and "Appalachia", the workers in the mines and farther south in the bountiful valley have taken to the moniker and made it their own. 

They say only three good things come out of those mountains: protein, iron, and methamphetamines.
