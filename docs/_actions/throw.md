name: Throw
description: Throw a grabbed opponent to the ground or throw an object.
---

Throw a person you are Grappling or an object you are holding. If you are currently the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to Throw them onto the ground, dealing your BODY STAT directly to their Hit Points in damage. **This damage ignores the Defender's armor and doesn't ablate it.**

Throwing your target ends your Grapple with them (freeing you both of the -2 to all Actions imposed by being either participant in a Grapple), and leaves them Prone, unable to use their Move Action until they use the Get Up Action.

If you want to Throw an object, you can do so by using an Action to make a Ranged Attack using DEX + Athletics + 1d10, up to a maximum of 25m/yds, using the Grenade Launcher DV entry on the range table. If you are throwing the object at a person that can dodge bullets, they can choose to dodge your object as well. Melee weapons deal their stated damage when thrown, but don't halve SP. Grenades deal the same damage as they would when fired from a grenade launcher. An improvised thrown weapon does as much damage as the GM thinks it would.
