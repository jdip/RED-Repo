<h2 id="jacking_in_out">Jacking In or Out</h2>
<p>
    Using a NET Action, you can Jack In to a NET
    Architecture while within range (within 6 m/yds,
    blocked by walls) of one of its access points. Being
    jacked in is a prerequisite for doing anything in an
    Architecture. Moving out of the access point's range
    while jacked in to the Architecture jacks you out of the
    NET Architecture automatically, but leaves you vulnerable:
    You suffer the effect of all remaining
    enemy Black ICE you've encountered, but not
    Derezzed, in the NET Architecture before you
    get "out." Black ICE will be explained later (on pg.
    204), but you don't want this to happen to you.
</p>
<p>
    It is much safer to use a NET Action to Jack Out
    from within the access point's range. Jacking Out
    "resets" the defenses of a NET Architecture,
    meaning you'll have to start your run over
    from the very beginning, which can only be
    done by jacking back in to the same location
    you originally entered and giving it another
    shot. All your Programs leave the Architecture with
    you when you Jack Out. If you want to have a permanent
    effect on the Architecture, you'll have to reach the
    bottom to leave a Virus.

                1d10 and adding their Interface (7), they get a 14.
                With this roll, the GM determines that the Netrunner
                learns the Meatspace location of two of the nearby
                access points for the building's NET Architecture.

                with their Virus, so they use a NET Action to use their
                Cloak Ability. They roll Interface (7) + 1d10, getting a
                16! An enemy Netrunner will have to beat this number

                Action. Operating each individual thing attached to
                the node requires a separate NET Action once you
                have taken hold of the Control Node, and can be
                done from anywhere in the Architecture as long as you
                are still in control of the Control Node. <strong>Each Control

                The DV to wrest a Control Node currently held by

                Ability they roll Interface (7) + 1d10 and beat the

                9. Unfortunately, the File was a dummy left in the
