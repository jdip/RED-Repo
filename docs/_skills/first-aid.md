At a Base 10, you have basic first-aid training and
know how to handle injuries in the field. When
someone calls for a doctor in an emergency,
you're not the best choice but you can get the
job done. At a Base 14, you can take care of all
simple wounds and keep people from dying. You
probably carry a Medtech bag with you just in
case. At a Base 18, you are a miracle worker with
a medkit. As long as you're on your feet, death is
going to have to wait.
