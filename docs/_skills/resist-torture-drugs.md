At a Base 10, you've probably had some experiences
with interrogation or hard drugs, and it's
given you some knowledge of how to handle them.
At a Base 14, you've trained yourself to withstand
the garden-variety interrogation of the NCPD and
several different poisons and drugs. At a Base 18,
you're extremely hard to crack and you can shake
off the effects of most poisons and drugs. You can
withstand even the torture of psychos like the Iron
Sights gang.
