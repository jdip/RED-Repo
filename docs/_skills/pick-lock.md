At a Base 10, you can jimmy most simple locks and
you never get locked out of your apartment for long.
At a Base 14, you could be a competent cat burglar.
You can crack most safes if you have the right tools
and enough time. At a Base 18, you could build a
rep as a master cracksman. You can crack stock safes
like they were nothing and if you got a chance at it,
you could probably crack the bespoke vaults of any
number of Corps in the City.
