At a Base 10, you have some skill in disguise and
acting. You can make solid disguises as long as
they aren't too intensive, and you can convince most
people you are who you say you are. At a Base
14, you are a skilled impersonator, actor, and disguise
artist. You can mimic voices with solid results
and create disguises that include more complicated
aspects like changes in race or highly advanced or
reduced age. At a Base 18, you are so good you
could probably pick a person on the street and
completely steal their life. Even their own friends and
family wouldn't know the difference. As long as you
get rid of the original first.
