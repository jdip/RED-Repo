---

At a Base 10, you can use all databases and even
search libraries and physical manifests of information.
At a Base 14, you could easily access the
Library of Congress (if it was still there) and find rare
facts pertaining to old subjects. At a Base 18, you
can comprehend any public database and most
private databases. You can find extremely obscure
facts and you're pretty sure you could even find facts
and files from before the DataKrash if there weren't
so many R.A.B.I.D.S.
