At a Base 10, you know how to approach a wild
animal without scaring it off, and you've kept a pet
before. At a Base 14, you have the skill to train
animals for other people, and you've encountered a
few different animals in your life. At a Base 18, you
may have worked with Biotechnica at some point on
the various synthetics and cloned animals coming out
recently. You can calm down just about any animal,
and can train animals professionally for groups like
the NCPD.
