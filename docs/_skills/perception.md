At a Base 10, you know how to keep an eye out and
your spatial awareness is better than the average
person. At a Base 14, you always know roughly
what's going on around you and only trained professionals
can sneak up on you. At a Base 18, you are
trained to scan rooms for traps, you can spot tiny clues
like scratches on door knobs, and you can predict
who is entering a room by how they turn that knob.
