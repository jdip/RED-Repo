While others may play at worldwide dominance, Coca-Cola Disney is the true mega-corp that others either admire or despise. An American based powerhouse of a conglomerate after the style of the Japanese Zaibatsus, their sugary tentacles have the likes of IBM, Lockheed-Martin, Ruger, Ford, and GE within their corporate grasp. This last bastion of American Corporate Exceptionalism exerts a shocking amount of global influence for one with such a seemingly myopic focus on past American greatness.
