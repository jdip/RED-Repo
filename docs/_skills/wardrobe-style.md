At a Base 10, you are good at choosing clothes off
the rack. You can put together a stylish looking outfit
and coordinate everything you're wearing from your
shoes to your cyberware. At a Base 14, your friends
ask you for wardrobe tips, and you have the skill to
design professional outfits for them on
commission. At a Base 18, you are one
of those rare people whose personal
style influences major fashion trends. It's
probably not long before you get scouted
by one of the major fashion Corps.
