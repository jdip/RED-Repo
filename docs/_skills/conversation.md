At a Base 10, you are a smooth talker who can coerce
their subject into telling them simple information. At a
Base 14, you would make an excellent interviewer,
convincing subjects to tell you anecdotes about
the past, pontificate about favorite interests and
philosophies, etc. At a Base 18, you have the skill to
gently maneuver a person into telling you everything,
including extremely personal information, like how
they have an illegitimate son and the fact that no one
ever truly loved them.
