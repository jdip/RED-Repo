At a Base 10, you've got quick fingers and deep
pockets. You can make a good deal of money
pick pocketing people on the street, as long as you
don't push your luck. At a Base 14, you have the
skill needed to start operating in a Corporate Zone
where the real money is. You can lift a wallet and ID
badges no problem. At a Base 18, you could lift a
Solo's wallet, stop them to apologize for bumping into
them, and lift their pistol while you're at it. ID badges,
watches, glasses, grenades, it's all fair game.
