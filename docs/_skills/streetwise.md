At a Base 10, you can get some "hot" items, score
street drugs, and figure out who's the best Fixer in the
neighborhood. At a Base 14, you know how to get
in contact with a Solo to arrange a murder contract,
you might know a few mobsters, and you know which
neighborhoods to steer clear of. At a Base 18, you
have the skill to become a major crime lord yourself
and skip the middlemen. You know the right Fixers to
talk to and the right palms to grease.
