At a Base 10, you've practiced some moves and
could dance at a wedding and impress the bride and
groom. At a Base 14, you could compete in one of
Ziggurat's sponsored dance competitions and probably
make it to the semi-finals. At a Base 18, you are
probably well known for your dance moves and may
even get requests from Corps for you to perform at
their social functions.
