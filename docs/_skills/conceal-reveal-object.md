At a Base 10, you've got some experience with
street magic and maybe you know a few common
hiding places. At a Base 14, you've learned the most
common hiding places and can slip small items past
customs. Maybe you work as a smuggler or an investigator
part-time. At a Base 18, you are seasoned in
the art of concealment. It's rare that anything goes
unnoticed, and you could smuggle a handgun into
President Kress' office.
