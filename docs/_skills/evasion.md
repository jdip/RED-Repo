---

At a Base 10, you're fast on your feet and when in
need you can usually get out of the way. At a Base 14,
you're quick enough to dodge most gangers and you
can even hold your own against skilled combatants
armed with monokatanas and monofilament whips. At
a Base 18, you've trained your body to start moving
before your brain even responds to what's happening
around you.t
