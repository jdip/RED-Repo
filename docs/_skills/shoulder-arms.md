At a Base 10, you know how to maintain and accurately
fire assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, and
other shoulder-braced firearms. At a Base 14, you
are skilled enough to hit complicated shots like firing
through windows to hit targets in buildings and you
can almost always hit a target in the sweet spot of
your range. At a Base 18, you are the equal of rifle
sharpshooters like Annie Oakley and famous snipers
such as Vasily Zaytsev. In most cases, if you can see a
target you can hit it. It's probably not long before the
security Corps start fighting over you.
