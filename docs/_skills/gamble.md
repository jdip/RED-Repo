At a Base 10, you know how to play cards and you've
been to a few casinos. You win more than you loseâ€”
unless you go to a Corp or mob casino. At a Base
14, you have the skill to be a professional gambler.
You know how to play all the major games and you
can usually double your money when you play. At
a Base 18, you're a master gambler. Whether that's
counting cards, calling bluffs, reading tells, or some
other eldritch skill you've learned it well enough to be
really dangerous to anyone who gambles with you.
You've probably been banned from a casino or two.
