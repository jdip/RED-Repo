At a Base 10, you can usually tell when you're not
getting the whole truth and you're adept at reading
people's emotions. At a Base 14, you can detect
subtle evasions and mood swings with ease, and
you've learned the tells of most of your companions.
At a Base 18, you can not only detect subtle emotional
clues, but if a person is hiding something, you can
usually tell what they're hiding in a general sense.
