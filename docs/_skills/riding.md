At a Base 10, you've had the rare luxury of seeing
and riding a horse. You know the basics of how to
keep it from haring off. At a Base 14, somehow, you've
had a great deal of experience riding (whether that's
horses or other animals) and you are a very competent
rider, able to make quick maneuvers and adjustments.
At a Base 18, you can really connect with the
creature you're riding to get the most out of them. You
could and probably have at some point competed
in Corporate dressage competitions. Horses are
extremely rare and talented riders are even rarer.
