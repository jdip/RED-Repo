At a Base 10, you've been around the block a few
times and know how to deal with bureaucrats to avoid
getting trapped in red tape. At a Base 14, you've
worked with bureaucracies long enough to really
start unraveling an organization's secrets. You know
how to expedite orders, make sure your papers end
up on the right desks, and even block other people's
requests with Corps and government officials. At a
Base 18, you are masterful at working the system.
You know how to get just about anything you need
done, tie up opposition in red tape for ages, and even
manipulate the bureaucracy to create false claims and
paperwork.
