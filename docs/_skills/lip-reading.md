At a Base 10, you've spent enough time snooping on
conversations to pick up a few words here and there.
At a Base 14, you can read all sorts of people including
those with heavy accents and partially obscured
mouths. At a Base 18, you could dictate a conversation
from 10m/yds away through a snowstorm, with
one eye closed.
