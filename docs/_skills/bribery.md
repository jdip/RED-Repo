---

At a Base 10, you know how to bribe a guard to look
the other way or keep a witness from spilling simple
secrets. At a Base 14, you have a knack for reading
people and knowing how to manipulate them. You've
made tons of deals and you've got the skill to bribe
witnesses not to stand trial, coerce the NCPD into
leaving your operations alone for a night, and maybe
even convince a corporate hit squad that you're more
valuable alive. At a Base 18, you are a master of
greasing palms. Everyone wants something and you
have a gift for knowing exactly what to offer. Even the
most incorruptible people in City are hard pressed to
deny your offer.
