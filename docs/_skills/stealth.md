At a Base 10, you can get past most guards, or your
parents if you've been grounded. At a Base 14, you
are good enough to slip smoothly from shadow to
shadow and not make any noise. You can avoid
guards and lose pursuers easily. At a Base 18, you
are the equal of the corporate ninja employed by
Arasaka. If you want to go unnoticed, there are few
people who can spot you.
