At a Base 10, you are trained with melee weapons.
You can hold your own in a sword fight or a knife
fight and if you get your hands on a lead pipe you
can be a pretty dangerous bar fight opponent. At a
Base 14, you are well-versed in the ins and outs of
melee combat. You probably carry a melee weapon
with you just in case and it may be your preferred
weapon. At a Base 18, you have the skill to fight just
about anyone in the City in a melee bout. You might
even be able to duel the legendary Kenichi Zaburo in
a one-on-one sword fight and come out alive.
