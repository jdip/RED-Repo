At a Base 10, you have a basic knowledge of how
large-scale battles go and you could lead a battalion
in a low stakes conflict pretty easily. At a Base 14, you
have studied up and learned a great deal about the
flow of battle. You can easily out-think gangers and
rent-a-cops and predict your opposition's moves. At a
Base 18, you are a tactical mastermind, able to play
speed chess against even the most skilled tacticians.
You could be a great military general.
