At a Base of 10, you have the skill to infallibly find out
if your mainline is lying to you and you've got a basic
knowledge of "advanced interrogation techniques."
At a Base 14, you are a professionally proficient
interrogator, equivalent to a skilled detective grilling
a suspect. Depending on how moral you are, you may
also be skilled in prying information out of subjects
more forcefully. At a Base 18, you are on par with
the famous Media, Lyle Thompson, allowing you to
make even the most powerful people sweat with just a
few words. If push comes to shove, you are very well
acquainted with instruments of torture.
