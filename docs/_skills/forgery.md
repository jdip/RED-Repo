At a Base 10, you can fake simple IDs and you can
be fairly sure of whether any document handed to you
is false. At a Base 14, you can pass forgeries off to
all but the most sophisticated examination and rarely
do forgeries get by your initial inspection. At a Base
18, you could display your fakes in the best museums.
