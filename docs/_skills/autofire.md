At a Base 10, you can fire an assault rifle in full auto
and keep the climb down but you'd better be in the
sweet spot of your range to hit. At a Base 14, you're
more used to controlling an Autofire weapon and you
can keep your groupings fairly tight. It's likely that
you have an SMG or an Assault Rifle as your primary
weapon. At a Base 18, you can accurately hit targets
out to 100m/yds if you have the perfect conditions
and a little luck. You are a terror on the battlefield who
can riddle an opponent with bullets with the accuracy
of a finely tuned machine.
