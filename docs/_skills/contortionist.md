At a Base 10, you can slip out of handcuffs sometimes
and fit yourself into slightly tight spaces. At a Base
14, you have practiced your contortion and yoga is
probably part of your daily ritual. You can slip out
of handcuffs and bindings with relative ease and fit
yourself into small cupboards. At a Base 18, you could
be traveling with a circus. You can touch your toes to
your head, slip out of complex rope bindings, and
squeeze your body into spaces that would make an
octopus sweat.
