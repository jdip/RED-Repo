A Wetleaf clan whose patron saint is James Hetfield of Metallica. Primary rivals of the [McGraws]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _organizations/mcgraws.md %})
 
 Their internal culture is a fusion of 80's metalheads and 90's Insane Clown Posse meth cult. Snobbish in the extreme in regard to musical taste, the Hetfield's see classical metal as the height of the form. They are the most inclusive clan in Wetleaf, accepting outsiders into the clan who dive head first into their meth fueled cult family.

They are also into outlandish displays, which lends many members to actively seek out some of the more unusual body modifications to be seen in Constance City. Consequently, the Hetfield's endure a fairly high rate of cases of cyber-psychosis.
