At a Base 10, you're a pretty good bar brawler and
you can hold your own in a fist fight. You know how to
throw a punch and some of the intricacies of wrestling.
At a Base 14, you could be a professional fighter in
any number of pit-fighting arenas or official venues
around the City. You can lay out most opponents and
while you don't have a lot of finesse you know how
to use your strength to your advantage. At a Base
18, you are a seasoned fighter with an iron grip and
a mean right hook. All it takes is one good punch or
perfectly executed grapple for most people to think
twice about fighting you.
