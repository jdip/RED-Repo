At a Base 10, you are generally a tough customer.
Maybe you grew up in the outskirts or traveling with
a Nomad pack. At a Base 14, you are trained in
surviving harsh conditions and capable of living on
the streets with no home or shelter, though not comfortably.
If need be, you could flee to the badlands
outside the City to escape trouble. At a Base 18,
you are well accustomed to dangerous terrain and
long-term hardship. You can live for long periods of
time with minimal nourishment, live entirely alone in
the Badlands and stay alert while on the run with no
problem.
