At a Base 10, you could fill in for Trauma Team as long
as the situation hasn't gotten too dire. You can splint
limbs and stabilize patients for transport to a hospital.
At a Base 14, you are more than skilled enough to
work as a Trauma Team Medical Assistant. If you
can get to a patient in time, you can make sure they
make it out in one piece. At a Base 18, you are the
equivalent of a seasoned first-responder with enough
medical knowledge to arrive on the scene of a firefight
or natural disaster and immediately start saving lives.
