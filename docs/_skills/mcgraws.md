A Wetleaf clan whose patron saint is Tim McGraw. Primary rivals of the [Hetfields]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _organizations/hetfields.md %})

The McGraws are an extended family with a long history in [Nekalacchia]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/nekalacchia.md %}). Having already been in business in the area, they were well positioned to rise alongside Constance City, and today maintain a stranglehold on much of the trade up out of the [Nekalacchia Valley]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _locations/nekalacchia-valley.md %}) into the greater metro area.

Insular to the extreme, the McGraws value purity and reject outside influences, but at the end of the day they realize that maintaining their position often requires allowances. Many of their foot-soldiers are as enhanced as any other group in the city with the means to do so.
