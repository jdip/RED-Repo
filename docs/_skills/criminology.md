At a Base 10, you've learned enough to
ruin precinct procedural dramas forever.
You know how to examine evidence, how
to properly maintain a crime scene, and
the basics of using police records. At a
So Many Skill s!
There's no defined Crew
in Cyberpunk RED. Your
group could be a bunch of
Edgerunners taking whatever
jobs come their way,
sure, but they could also
be a squad of Corporate
troubleshooters, a private
investigation firm, a team
of investigative reporters,
a Nomad smuggling pack,
or a Trauma Team crew.
There's a wide world out
there for you to explore
and we've done our best to
provide you with a full list of
Skills so you aren't pigeonholed
into one specific
kind of campaign. Some
of the Skills on the list might
not come up often in your
particular campaign and
you're free to ignore them.
Others will pop their heads
up no matter what type of
Cyberpunk story you're
telling. Those are the Basic
Skills and there's a reason
you have to have each
bought up to at least 2.
Players, if you're unsure
if you need Lip Reading
or Sea Vehicle Tech, talk
to your GM and find out
if they think those Skills will
come up in the game. And
GMs, it can be a great
practice to look over the
Character sheets of your
Players, once and a while,
and think about ways you
can work their chosen Skills
into the game to help them
solve problems.
Base 14, you have spent a good deal of
time studying criminology and it has paid
off. You can navigate police precincts and
records with ease and carry out murder
investigations unaided. At a Base 18, you
have the skill to be the next great detective.
You can breeze through complex calculations
to determine ballistics and blood
spatter; and within moments of stepping
on the scene of a crime you can get a
clear view of exactly what happened. It
takes a really unusual case to stump you.
