At a Base 10, you can put two and two
together and figure out most logical leaps,
no problem. You can always deduce
where you left your keys or how likely it
is that the rash on your arm is deadly. At
a Base 14, you have trained your mind
to collect clues and organize them to
make better deductions. You can make
accurate long-range deductions like how
long it will be before the gangers figure
out you sold them dud cyberware. At a
Base 18, your skills rival that of Sherlock Holmes. You
are at the level of a world-class detective, building
accurate deductions and predictions from the smallest
clues imaginable. Some people may even think you're
psychic.
