At a Base 10, you have piloted sea vehicles before,
and you know the ins and outs of naval travel and
combat. You can handle choppy water and hold your
own in a skirmish. At a Base 14, you have spent a
great deal of time on the water and probably been in
a few naval encounters. You know how to come out
on top in an even engagement. At a Base 18, you are
a veteran of the seas, able to sail a cargo freighter
through a hurricane and maneuver a speedboat
through a slalom of debris and enemy ships.
