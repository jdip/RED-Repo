At a Base 10, you are the equal of a very good
non-professional driver. You know how to handle
yourself on the road and deal with road rage. At a
Base 14, you are the equal of a moderately skilled
race car driver. You can make bootlegger turns, jump
small gaps, and drive in dangerous terrain. At a Base
18, you have the skill to be nationally known as a
racer and probably can score a sponsorship deal with
some of the biggest vehicle manufacturers out there.
