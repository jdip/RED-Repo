At a Base 10, you have learned to fix your guns when
they break and sharpen your knives when the edges
wear out. You have the skills to keep your weapons
in pretty good shape. At a Base 14, you are a skilled
Weaponstech who can rebuild most pistols and
cheaper guns after catastrophic mishaps. And putting
an edge back on a sword is no problem at all. At a
Base 18, you have learned the ins and outs of weaponry,
allowing you to fix up just about anything. Given
a radiation suit, a wheelbarrow, and a bodyguard
team you could probably make quite a bit of money
salvaging destroyed tech from the Hot Zone.
