At a Base 10, you are a fairly skilled archer who can
hit a target easily in the range of your weapon. At a
Base 14, you are skilled enough to hit shots that the
average archer would struggle to land and you can
almost always hit a target in the sweet spot of your
range. At a Base 18, you are an archer to rival Robin
Hood with enough skill to hit targets hundreds of m/
yds away and perform stunts like shooting things out
of people's hands.
