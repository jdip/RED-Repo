At a Base 10, you know how to maintain and accurately
fire rocket launchers, grenade launchers,
railguns, and other heavy weaponry. At a Base 14,
you've had the training to really excel at firing heavy
weaponry. You are deadly accurate with rockets and
grenades and you could easily serve as a mounted-
turret gunner in the next Corporate War. At a
Base 18, you have the skill to be a master with heavy
weaponry. You know this machinery so well you can
make trick shots with railguns and drop grenades
down chimneys at 100m/yds.
