At a Base 10, you know the area pretty well; where
to go to get whatever you need, where to avoid, what
the local public factions are like. At a Base 14, you
are well acquainted with the area and not only do you
know the basics but you are aware of the underlying
problems, factions, and rules that the average tourist
isn't. At a Base 18, you could act as a tour guide for
the area. You've poked your nose in everywhere,
talked to most of the people, seen the sights, and
experienced most of what the area has to offer. You
are almost never at a loss for info.
