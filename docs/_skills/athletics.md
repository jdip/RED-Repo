At a Base 10, you are the equivalent of a real high
school "jock," able to run long distances and lift a
respectable amount. At a Base 14, you can perform
in college-level competitions and hold your own in all
sorts of athletic challenges. At a Base 18, you are of
Olympic or professional caliber and it's rare you meet
someone who matches your skill.
