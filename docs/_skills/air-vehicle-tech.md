at maintaining and repairing AVs,
Gyrocopters, Helicopters, and other
flying vehicles. At a Base 14, you are a
skilled mechanic who can easily repair
almost any damage to an air vehicle
given enough time. At a Base 18, you
can rebuild an AV-4 from a smoking pile
of rubble in just a week and can fix up a
broken rotor with your eyes closed.
