At a Base 10, you've done some hunting (whether
that's animals or people is up to you). At a Base
14, you could be a professional bounty hunter, with
enough knowledge to track people who are actively
covering their tracks. At a Base 18, you are almost
impossible to shake. Once you get a trail, you can
follow it to the ends of the earth.
