At a Base 10, you've learned how to code
your messages well enough to keep the
average person from figuring out what
you're saying or writing and crack basic
codes. At a Base 14, you have a lot of
practice cracking codes and communicating
in code. You could work for the CIA
or any other secret service and get along
fine. At a Base 18, you are a master of
cryptography. There's no code or encryption
out there that you can't crack given
some time, and when you encode something
you can be sure no one's gonna be
decoding it without a professional cryptography
team.
