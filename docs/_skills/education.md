At a Base 10, you have the equivalent of a basic
college education. You have much more education
than the average person in Night City. At a Base 14,
you have a great deal of education, equal to having
a Masters or a Doctorate. You probably don't actually
have one due to the state of education in Night City.
At a Base 18, you are an extremely well-educated
person; one of those people who "knows a lot about
everything" (and hopefully has the good sense to keep
their mouth shut).
