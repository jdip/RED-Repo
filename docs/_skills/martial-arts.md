At a Base 10, you are trained in a martial art and
can perform the basic movements. You've got more
going for you than the average brawler. At a Base
14, you've reached a level of training in your martial
art that allows you to get a bit fancy. You can reliably
pull off special moves like disarming foes, reversing
throws, and landing combos. At a Base 18, you are
a master martial artist on par with legendary greats
such as Ip Man, Bruce Lee, and Mas Oyama. You
can perform complicated maneuvers that crack skulls,
paralyze opponents, and tear apart armor.
