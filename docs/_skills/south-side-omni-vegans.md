The North Side Omni-Vegans are a vegan activist group that promotes the idea that eating vat-meat is compatible with veganism since no actual living animal with a mind is harmed. 

The South Side Omni-Vegans are a militant radical splinter group that believes there is only one food source that is a net-gain for mother nature.
