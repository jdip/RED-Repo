At a Base 10, you've got a pretty solid memory and
can keep your head in a firefight against the local
boosters. At a Base 14, you've trained your mind to
retain knowledge, and probably meditate regularly.
It takes a fair amount to shake you. At a Base 18, your
mind is like a steel trap with a 24/7 lock down. You
can walk through gunfire and never flinch.
