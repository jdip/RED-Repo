At a Base 10, you can speak the language well
enough to get by on the street but you don't understand
a lot of the slang. At a Base 14, you are a fluent
speaker of the language and most people assume you
grew up speaking the language. At a Base 18, you
not only speak the language fluently but you know
all the ins and outs of the language including slang,
complicated situational rules, and all dialects of the
language.
