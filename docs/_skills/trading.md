At a Base 10, you are a solid trader who can haggle
deals, and get a good deal on ammunition at the
local market. At a Base 14, you have the skill to make
deals with Nomad caravans to get new goods at
reasonable prices and you are probably well known
at the local Night Market. At a Base 18, you are a
master of economic maneuvering and can buy and
sell goods for astonishing value. Now all you have
to do is make sure you don't get on the wrong side of
the local Fixers.
