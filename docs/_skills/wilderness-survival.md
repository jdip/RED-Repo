At a Base 10, you have the survival skills of the
average Boy Scout. You can go camping and if
dumped in the middle of the wilderness you would
know how to survive with the proper gear. At a Base
14, you are a skilled survivalist with enough knowledge
to survive in basically any environment with relative
comfort. You are at about the level of a Special
Forces Green Beret. At a Base 18, you have learned
enough to not only survive but thrive. You no longer
need tools to survive in the wilderness and you could
be dropped in the middle of the Rocky Mountains with
nothing but the clothes on your back and still make it
look easy.
