At a Base 10, you are a trained pilot, able to engage
in most combat situations or pilot an AV through bad
weather. At a Base 14, you are a veteran pilot with a
lot of time in the cockpit. You can handle yourself in
almost any situation, including making complicated
aerobatic maneuvers. At a Base 18, you have the skills
to be widely known among the piloting community
for having the "right stuff." You can fly through storms
and thread the needle between buildings in an AV-4.
